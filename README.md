This is my first project on HTML through The Odin Project.
It requires me to create a basic recipe website which will 
have recipes of three different dishes.

The skills and elements used in this project are:
- html boilerplate
- header
- images
- links
- lists
- text formatting

It will be styled up with CSS later.
