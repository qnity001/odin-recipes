Food. Everyone loves food!

Weclome to this website that contains the recipe of some top
dishes that I would like to have. 
This is my first project on HTML through The Odin Project.
It requires me to create a recipe website which will 
have recipes of three different dishes.

The skills and concepts used in this project are:
- html boilerplate
- header and its levels
- images
- links
- lists
- text formatting


It will be styled up with CSS later.
