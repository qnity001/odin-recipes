        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Tteokbbokki is chewy rice cakes cooked in a red, spicy broth. It's a popular Korean street food.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of cyclinder shaped rice cake (tteok), bought or homemade. (Use a little more if you're not adding hard boiled eggs and fish cakes</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
            <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru) aka "Korean chili flakes"</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
            <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
            <li>&frac12; pound fish cakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, dried anchovies and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
            <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
            <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes) and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies andd kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2&frac12; cups</li>
            <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the tteokbokki sauce thicken and looks shiny. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>If the cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. When you use freshly made  rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot. If you have any leftovers, just keep them in the fridge and reheat them when you want to eat it.</li>
        </ol>
